<p>May is Mental Wellness Month, a time dedicated to raising awareness about the importance of mental health, and a reminder for all of us to make time for self care in our daily routine. And who needs that reminder more than the freelance community?

</p>

    The demanding nature of the freelance lifestyle often makes it hard to prioritize wellbeing and self care. While freelancing can offer great benefits such as flexibility and creative freedom, it is far from being a care-free lifestyle. Having to manage your own workload, juggle multiple projects simultaneously, and meeting client expectations can definitely take its toll on your mental wellbeing and leave you feeling isolated, stressed, fatigued and burnt out.
